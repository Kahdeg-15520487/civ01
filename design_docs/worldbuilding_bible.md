> "All reality is but a rune inscribed upon the void."

## 1. The World: Tianwen (Heaven's Inscription)

**Core Concept:** A world where the laws of physics are programmable via Qi-infused calligraphy (Runes). Most of the ancient "source code" (The Grand Formation) has been lost or corrupted.

### 1.1 The Creation Myth
In the **Void Era**, there was only chaos. The **Dao Ancestor (道祖)**, holding the Brush of Origin, wrote a single character: **"Order" (道)**. This primary rune fractured into the Five Elements, stabilizing reality. The Ancestor then inscribed the **Grand Formation (大阵)**, a planetary-scale circuit to regulate the flow of Qi and maintain the world's integrity.
