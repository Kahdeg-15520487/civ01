# Worldbuilding Bible - Tianwen Continent (天纹大陆)

> "To write code is to write reality. To bugs is to invite ruin."

---

## 1. The World: Tianwen (Heaven's Inscription)

**Core Concept:** A world where the laws of physics are programmable via Qi-infused calligraphy (Runes). The "Source Code" of reality is known as the **Grand Dao**, but access to it is restricted, fragmented, and dangerous.

### 1.1 The Genesis Architecture
In the **Void Era (Null State)**, there was only uninitialized memory. The **Dao Ancestor (道祖)**, the First Admin, executed the `Genesis.exe` command (The First Stroke).
- **The Compile:** Reality stabilized into the Five Elements.
- **The Kernel:** The Grand Formation was established to manage Qi allocation, gravity, and sunlight.
- **The Ascension:** The Dao Ancestor left the server (Ascended) but left behind the **Terminal of Origin**—a mythical location where one can rewrite the fundamental constants of the universe.

## 9. The Philosophies of Code (The Dao)

Different schools of thought on how to interact with the Source Code of Reality.

### 9.1 The Open Source Dao (Azure Peak)
> *"Knowledge hoarded is a stream dammed; it breeds stagnation. Let the Qi flow freely."*
- **Belief:** The Grand Formation failed because it was a "Black Box" no one understood.
- **Goal:** Document everything. Share findings. Decentralize power.
- **Practice:** Their libraries are open to the public (mostly).

### 9.2 The Proprietary Path (Ironheart Pavilion)
> *"The sword that kills is the one they didn't see you forge."*
- **Belief:** Power defines truth. If I wrote the code, I own the reality it creates.
- **Goal:** Create "Closed Garden" ecosystems where they control all variables.
- **Practice:** Use heavy encryption (Spirit Seals) on their artifacts. Disciples are sworn to secrecy by blood-oaths.

### 9.3 The Bio-Weavers (Crimson Lotus)
> *"Why build a machine when the body is the ultimate hardware?"*
- **Belief:** Metal and stone are dead. Only living code allows for true evolution.
- **Goal:** Transhumanism (Spirit-Body Cultivation).
- **Practice:** Grafting runes directly onto bone and meridian. Risky but allows instant execution without artifacts.

## 10. Bestiary: Glitches & Constructs

### 10.1 Logic-Beasts (Qi Constructs)
Artificial lifeforms created by ancient scripts that have kept running for millenia.

- **Packet Hawks:** Mechanical birds originally designed to carry messages. Now they swarm and steal any data-storage device (Jade Slips) they see.

### 10.2 Deviation Horrors (Bugs)
Creatures born from broken code or corrupted Qi.
- **Null-Walkers:** Humans who suffered a catastrophic "Stack Overflow" during meditation. They are physically present but spiritually empty, wandering aimlessly.
- **Infinite Loopers:** Spirits trapped repeating the last 5 seconds of their life forever. Touching them traps you in the loop.

### 11.1 The Great Architect (The First Admin)
- **Myth:** Designed the Grand Formation. said to have "ascended" by writing a rune so complex it teleported him outside of the universe.
- **Legacy:** Left behind "Backdoors" in reality that savvy Rune Engravers can exploit.

### 11.2 The Glitch Witch (Mistress of Exploits)
- **Role:** A controversial figure who discovered that writing contradictions (Fire + Water without a container) could generate infinite energy for a microsecond before exploding.

---

## 12. Sect Slang (Dev Speak)
